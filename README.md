# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a basic full-stack application allowing users to find a compatible friend based on their answers to 10 survey questions. Each person's answers to questions are written to /api/friends so that their profile can be used to make future matches. Compatibility is determined by the total difference between the user's answers and all previous users' answers. 

This is the first app I built with the Express web application framework for Node.js.

### CSS Framework

Given that this application has a simple layout, I took the opportunity to test out a new CSS framework, [Bulma](http://bulma.io/ "Bulma Homepage"). I found that Bulma is easy to pick up, has a nice simple design (that has a neater and fresher look than Bootstrap), and has enough components to add some design flexibility. It is based on flexbox, and this adds a nice responsiveness to the app.
